# Learning
- class allows to create an object with built in properties
- class `constructor` is the better way to add properties
- this keyword
- class extending to create child objects of the class that herits properties of the parent class
- `constructor` and `super` to rewrite or add properties to the child class
- importance of putting in constant the result of functions inside a class if I want to access it later
- using `...rest` as parameter to avoid typing each parameter in the constructor
